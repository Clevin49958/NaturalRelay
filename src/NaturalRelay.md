# Glossary
 - ART: artificial
 - NF: non-forcing
 - GF: game forcing
 - INV: invitational
 - !M/!m: **M**ajor/**m**inor
 - L/M/H: low, middle, higher suit
 - Rxx: relay with xx. E.g. R2!D: relay with 2!D (meaningless)
 - kc (lower case): keycard

# General Approach

 - 5 card Major, 1!C=16+; 1!D=1+!D, 11-15; 1NT=13-16, no 5M, no 6m, no (5422); 2!C=5!C+4M OR 6!C, 11-15.
 - Transfer GF responses to 1!C
 - INV+ Relay after 1 level opening (excluding 1!C), relay twice is GF. Most of other bids are (6)8-11 NAT, NF.
   - 1!D - 1!H: 4!H weak OR ART GF
   - 1M - 2!C: ART INV+
  
# Opening structure

 - 1!C: 16+ semi-bal, or 17+ bal
 - 1!D: can include
   - 11-12 Perfect-BAL
   - 6+!D
   - 5!D + 4 other
   - 5!C + no 4M
   - any 3 suiter (including !D shortage)
  - 1M: 11-15, 5M
  - 1NT: 13-16, Perfect-BAL (minor 5332, 4432, 4333)
  - 2!C: 11-15, 6+!C OR 5!C+4M
  - 2!D: 11-15, 6+!D, no 4 card side suit
  - 2!M: weak 2s
  - 2NT: minors 55
  - 3x: pre-empt of preference.
  - 3NT: Gambling.

# Relay Guideline

## Step 1: shape
The responder shows his shape. Any bid + 1 is relay. The enquirer may break the relay by bidding anything higher to skip to step 2 or sign off.

General principle when showing shape in relay:
1. Balanced hand: 4 card suit, 2nd 4 card suit, then 3 card suit to complete 4432.
1. Bid your first suit, then always second suit, then shortage
   - 54: first then second
   - 64: first then second
   - If there is a lower bid available and meaningless, use it to replace highest bid to show shortage.
2. If you rebid your suit, it's one card longer
   - 6: bid your first suit twice
   - 64: first suit, then second suit, then first suit again
3. Second suit cannnot be longer than first suit. Bid lower of equal length first. The order is H<S<C<D
   - C then D then D means 56
   - D then C then C means 55
4. There may be multiple ways to bid the same suits. A jump usually indicate a void/no shortage
   - 1!C - transfer 2 level = 6322 or hint a void
   - 1!C - suit once, suit twice = no void
5. Shape relay stops at 3NT. Any bid at 3NT or higher is not asking for shape. But the shape response may go beyond 3NT. 

## Step 2: Sign-off/Keycard
Partner may choose not to keycard. <br>
If partner makes a non-jumping game bid, it is sign-off.
Any 3NT immediately after complete shape relay is sign off.

After enquirer chooses to sign-off with a minimum, if the responder has extras, e.g. ultra-good 1M opening, 12+ responder to 1!C with good controls, he may responder to a sign-off bid with keycard.
E.g. 3NT (sign-off) - 4!H (+3 steps, 2 without Q, with extras)

After starting of keycard, any relay bid, even if it's also a game bid, is still relay. Do NOT relay further if you cannot tolerate the response.

### Keycard procedure

The enquirer is allowed to keycard in any suit, and keycard in any suit does not imply suit-setting the suit. Any bid breaking the relay after initiating the keycard procedure is the intended final contract, including 4NT.

Warning: 4NT is rarely used in relay for keycard.

#### Range
If responder's point range is wider or equal to 4 points, including 1x opening, 1NT (13-16), responding to 1!C opener, we recommend relay for point range.

 - +1: minimum (11-12 if 1x, 13-14 if 1NT, 8-11 if responding to 1!C)
 - +2: maximum, first step response in keycard
 - +3: maximum, second step response in keycard
 - so on

#### Keycard - A
The enquirer can choose to keycard in any suit. This is very beneficial if the enquirer want to do a pure A ask (gerber) or investigate Ks in case of a double fit, the enquirer can choose to keycard in a suit that he has the K.

The default relay bid is to keycard in responder's first suit. +2 bid for relay is in responder's second longest suit. +3/+4 are so on.<br>
In case of 2 suits are the same length, major first, then lower first. 

E.g. if p is 4225, then +1 = !C (longer), +2 = !H, +3 = !S (Major first), +4 = !D


We recommend RKCB, while even/odd responses can be used.
- +1: 1/4
- +2: 0/3
- +3: 2 no Q
- +4: 2 with Q

#### Keycard - K/Q
Relay once for K, and again for Q

 - +1: no
 - +2~4: L/M/H K or the other 2 side suit Ks

After the K&Q ask, the next relay seeks to clarify any confusion in case the enquirer is missing all 3 K/Qs in the side suit.
 - +1: I have one of each responded
 - +2: I have one extra honor
 - +3: I have two of each responded

#### Keycard - J
Respond side suit J in the same way as K/Q. If there are more space, the next relay is trump J, where +1=no, +2=yes.

## Shape classification

   4333, 4432, 5332 (5m), 4441
2. Single suit no shortage
   5332, 6322, 7222
3. Unbal:
   1. Single suit: 6331, 7321, 7330
   2. 5~7+4: 5431(22), 5440,  6421, 6430, 7411
   3. 55+: 5521, 5530, 6511, 6520, 6610

# Exact relay definition
## 1!C - 1!H (R1!S)
1NT (waiting bid) shows the higher suit (!S), any other bid shows !H. This applies in competition where X/XX is !S, P or any other bid shows !H.
- 1NT: 5!S (R2!C)
  - See [5!M relay](#5m-relay)
- 2!C: 4!C. (R2!D)
  - 2!H: 6+!H, =4!C (R2!S)
    - 2NT: replaces 3!D, !D shortage, =2614
    - 3!C: replaces 3!S, !S shortage, =1624
    - 3!H: 7!H, =1714
  - 2!S: 1!S, =1534 (R2NT = kc in !H) 
  - 2NT: 22, =2524
  - 3!C: 5!C. Deny void generally (R3!D)
    - 3!H: 6!H, 5!C, =1615
    - 3!S: !S shortage, =1525
    - 3NT: replaces 4!D, !D shortage, =2515
    - 4!C: 6!C, implies 6!H, take it slow so lower shortage, =1606
    - 4!D: originally meaningless, implies longer !H, =1705
  - 3!D: 1!D, =3514
  - 3!H: 7!H, jump implies void (R3!S for void if couldn't jump to differentiate void)
- 2!D: 4!D. (R2!H)
  - TODO
- 2!H+: See [5!M relay](#5m-relay)

## 5!M relay
5!M relay response starts after 2!C. 

Applicable situations include: 
 - 1!M - 2!C
 - 1!C - 1!H (- 1!S - 1NT) - 2!C

Key concept: 
 - !minor compression: 2!D shows an unknown 4+m. R2!H, 2!S=!D, anything else shows !C.
 - 2!H and 2!S are the same regardless of which !Major relayee has.

Relay: 
 - 2!D: unknown 4+!m (R2!H)
   - 2!S: !m=!D (R2NT)
     - Natural relay continuation
   - 2NT: 5422, unknown !minor (R3!C)
     - 3!D: min, (R3!H)
       - 3!S/3NT: !C/!D
     - 3!H/3!S: max, !C/!D
   - 3!C+: !m=!C, Natural relay continuation
 - 2!H: Single suited !M. 5322/6322/7321 (R2!S)
   - 2NT: 6(322)/7(321) (R3!C)
     - 3!D/3!oM/3NT: 6322, 3 in !D/!oM/!C 
     - 3!M: 7(32)1, low shortage
   - 3!C/3!D/3!oM: 5332, 2 in !C/!D/!oM
   - 3!M: 7(32)1, middle shortage
 - 2!S: 4!oM
 - 2NT: 6(331) (R3!C)
   - 3!D/3!oM/3NT: !D/!oM/!C shortage
   - 3!M: ? //TODO
 - 3!C: 55, implies void
 - 3!D: 55, implies void
 - 3!M: 7(32)1, high shortage
 - 3NT: 7222


## 1!C - 1!S (Bal), (R1NT)
Transfer to 1NT shows a balanced hand. This could include perfectly balanced ones including 4432, 4333, and semi-balanced ones including 5332 with 5m, and 4441.

1. 4333: bid the suit and then NT
2. 4432: bid 4 card suits up the line, and then your 3 card suit to complete the shape.
   1. If the second 4 card suit is the relay bid, then skip all bids that shows any 4 card suit, skip 2NT that shows a 4333, use 3!C/3!D to show the 3 card suit and a touching 4 card suit.
   2. If the next 2 bid matches the 2 unbid 3 card suit, then bid the matching one.
   3. If one of the bid matches the 2 unbid 3-card suit, then the one matches shows that suit.
   4. If both bids don't match, then the lower bid matches the lower suit
3. 5332: Use 2NT for 5!C and 3!C for 5!D
4. 4441: 3!D-3NT. 3!D-3!S shows matching singleton and 3NT shows !C singleton.
