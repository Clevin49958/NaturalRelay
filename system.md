# Natural Relay

Author: Keivn Hu

# Glossary
 - ART: artificial
 - NF: non-forcing
 - GF: game forcing
 - INV: invitational
 - M/m: **M**ajor/**m**inor
 - L/M/H: low, middle, higher suit
 - Rxx: relay with xx. E.g. R2D: relay with 2D (meaningless)
 - kc (lower case): keycard

# General Approach

 - 5 card Major, 1C=16+; 1D=1+<font color=orange>&diams;</font>, 11-15; 1NT=13-16, no 5M, no 6m, no (5422); 2C=5<font color=green>&clubs;</font>+4M OR 6<font color=green>&clubs;</font>, 11-15.
 - Transfer GF responses to 1C
 - INV+ Relay after 1 level opening (excluding 1C), relay twice is GF. Most of other bids are (6)8-11 NAT, NF.
   - 1D - 1H: 4<font color=red>&hearts;</font> weak OR ART GF
   - 1M - 2C: ART INV+
  
# Opening structure

 - 1C: 16+ semi-bal, or 17+ bal
 - 1D: can include
   - 11-12 Perfect-BAL
   - 6+<font color=orange>&diams;</font>
   - 5<font color=orange>&diams;</font> + 4 other
   - 5<font color=green>&clubs;</font> + no 4M
   - any 3 suiter (including <font color=orange>&diams;</font> shortage)
  - 1M: 11-15, 5M
  - 1NT: 13-16, Perfect-BAL (minor 5332, 4432, 4333)
  - 2C: 11-15, 6<font color=green>&clubs;</font> OR 5<font color=green>&clubs;</font>+4M
  - 2D & 2M: pre-empt of preference.
  - 2NT: minors 55
  - 3x: pre-empt of preference.
  - 3NT: Gambling.

# Relay Guideline

## Step 1: shape
The responder shows his shape. Any bid + 1 is relay. The enquirer may break the relay by bidding anything higher to skip to step 2 or sign off.

General principle when showing shape in relay:
1. Balanced hand: 4 card suit, 2nd 4 card suit, then 3 card suit to complete 4432.
1. Bid your first suit, then always second suit, then shortage
   - 54: first then second
   - 64: first then second
   - If there is a lower bid available and meaningless, use it to replace highest bid to show shortage.
2. If you rebid your suit, it's one card longer
   - 6: bid your first suit twice
   - 64: first suit, then second suit, then first suit again
3. Second suit cannnot be longer than first suit. Bid lower of equal length first. The order is H<S<C<D
   - C then D then D means 56
   - D then C then C means 55
4. There may be multiple ways to bid the same suits. A jump usually indicate a void/no shortage
   - 1C - transfer 2 level = 6322 or hint a void
   - 1C - suit once, suit twice = no void
5. Shape relay stops at 3NT. Any bid at 3NT or higher is not asking for shape. But the shape response may go beyond 3NT. 

## Step 2: Sign-off/Keycard
Partner may choose not to keycard. <br>
If partner makes a non-jumping game bid, it is sign-off.
Any 3NT immediately after complete shape relay is sign off.

After enquirer chooses to sign-off with a minimum, if the responder has extras, e.g. ultra-good 1M opening, 12+ responder to 1C with good controls, he may responder to a sign-off bid with keycard.
E.g. 3NT (sign-off) - 4H (+3 steps, 2 without Q, with extras)

After starting of keycard, any relay bid, even if it's also a game bid, is still relay. Do NOT relay further if you cannot tolerate the response.

### Keycard procedure

The enquirer is allowed to keycard in any suit, and keycard in any suit does not imply suit-setting the suit. Any bid breaking the relay after initiating the keycard procedure is the intended final contract, including 4NT.

Warning: 4NT is rarely used in relay for keycard.

#### Range
If responder's point range is wider or equal to 4 points, including 1x opening, 1NT (13-16), responding to 1C opener, we recommend relay for point range.

 - +1: minimum (11-12 if 1x, 13-14 if 1NT, 8-11 if responding to 1C)
 - +2: maximum, first step response in keycard
 - +3: maximum, second step response in keycard
 - so on

#### Keycard - A
The enquirer can choose to keycard in any suit. This is very beneficial if the enquirer want to do a pure A ask (gerber) or investigate Ks in case of a double fit, the enquirer can choose to keycard in a suit that he has the K.

The default relay bid is to keycard in responder's first suit. +2 bid for relay is in responder's second longest suit. +3/+4 are so on.<br>
In case of 2 suits are the same length, major first, then lower first. 

E.g. if p is 4225, then +1 = <font color=green>&clubs;</font> (longer), +2 = <font color=red>&hearts;</font>, +3 = <font color=blue>&spades;</font> (Major first), +4 = <font color=orange>&diams;</font>


We recommend RKCB, while even/odd responses can be used.
- +1: 1/4
- +2: 0/3
- +3: 2 no Q
- +4: 2 with Q

#### Keycard - K/Q
Relay once for K, and again for Q

 - +1: no
 - +2~4: L/M/H K or the other 2 side suit Ks

After the K&Q ask, the next relay seeks to clarify any confusion in case the enquirer is missing all 3 K/Qs in the side suit.
 - +1: I have one of each responded
 - +2: I have one extra honor
 - +3: I have two of each responded

#### Keycard - J
Respond side suit J in the same way as K/Q. If there are more space, the next relay is trump J, where +1=no, +2=yes.

## Shape classification
1. Bal/Semi-bal
   4333, 4432, 5332 (5m), 4441
2. Single suit no shortage
   5332, 6322, 7222
3. Unbal:
   1. Single suit: 6331, 7321, 7330
   2. 5~7+4: 5431(22), 5440,  6421, 6430, 7411
   3. 55+: 5521, 5530, 6511, 6520, 6610
   4. 
## Exact relay definition
### 1C - 1H - 1S, could jumped earlier
1NT (waiting bid) shows the higher suit (<font color=blue>&spades;</font>), any other bid shows <font color=red>&hearts;</font>. This applies in competition where X is <font color=blue>&spades;</font>, P or any other bid shows <font color=red>&hearts;</font>.
- 1NT: 5<font color=blue>&spades;</font>
- 2C: 4<font color=green>&clubs;</font>. (R2D)
  - 2H: 6+<font color=red>&hearts;</font>, =4<font color=green>&clubs;</font> (R2S)
    - 2NT: replaces 3D, <font color=orange>&diams;</font> shortage, =2614
    - 3C: replaces 3S, <font color=blue>&spades;</font> shortage, =1624
    - 3H: 7<font color=red>&hearts;</font>, =1714
  - 2S: 1<font color=blue>&spades;</font>, =1534 (R2NT = kc in <font color=red>&hearts;</font>) 
  - 2NT: 22, =2524
  - 3C: 5<font color=green>&clubs;</font>. Deny void generally (R3D)
    - 3H: 6<font color=red>&hearts;</font>, 5<font color=green>&clubs;</font>, =1615
    - 3S: <font color=blue>&spades;</font> shortage, =1525
    - 3NT: replaces 4D, <font color=orange>&diams;</font> shortage, =2515
    - 4C: 6<font color=green>&clubs;</font>, implies 6<font color=red>&hearts;</font>, take it slow so lower shortage, =1606
    - 4D: originally meaningless, implies longer <font color=red>&hearts;</font>, =1705
  - 3D: 1<font color=orange>&diams;</font>, =3514
  - 3H: 7<font color=red>&hearts;</font>, jump implies void (R3S for void if couldn't jump to differentiate void)
- 2D: 4<font color=orange>&diams;</font>. (R2H)
  - TODO
- 2H: 6<font color=red>&hearts;</font>, denies side suit (R2S)
  - 2NT: replaces 3S, shows 1<font color=blue>&spades;</font>, =1633
  - 3C: 1<font color=green>&clubs;</font>, =3631
  - 3D: 1<font color=orange>&diams;</font>, =3613
  - 3H: 7<font color=red>&hearts;</font>, 1H-2H-3H, low shortage, 1<font color=green>&clubs;</font>, 7<font color=red>&hearts;</font>, (32)
- 2S: 4<font color=blue>&spades;</font>
- 2NT: 5332 (R3C for LMH doubleton)

### 1C - 1S (Bal), (R1NT)
Transfer to 1NT shows a balanced hand. This could include perfectly balanced ones including 4432, 4333, and semi-balanced ones including 5332 with 5m, and 4441.

1. 4333: bid the suit and then NT
2. 4432: bid 4 card suits up the line, and then your 3 card suit to complete the shape.
   1. If the second 4 card suit is the relay bid, then skip all bids that shows any 4 card suit, skip 2NT that shows a 4333, use 3C/3D to show the 3 card suit and a touching 4 card suit.
   2. If the next 2 bid matches the 2 unbid 3 card suit, then bid the matching one.
   3. If one of the bid matches the 2 unbid 3-card suit, then the one matches shows that suit.
   4. If both bids don't match, then the lower bid matches the lower suit
3. 5332: Use 2NT for 5<font color=green>&clubs;</font> and 3C for 5<font color=orange>&diams;</font>
4. 4441: 3D-3NT. 3D-3S shows matching singleton and 3NT shows <font color=green>&clubs;</font> singleton.
